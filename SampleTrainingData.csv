The primary data ingestion service account, data-ingest-sa@data-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com, needs to write data to our BigQuery datasets (raw_data, processed_data, analytics_data), and also upload files to Cloud Storage buckets designated for data staging (data-staging-a, data-staging-b). They also need to trigger Dataflow jobs for ETL processing. Our data science team, data-science-team@my-org.com, needs read access to all BigQuery datasets and storage buckets, and they should be able to run BigQuery queries and Dataflow jobs. Furthermore, a separate team, report-generators@my-org.com, requires read-only access to the analytics_data dataset for reporting purposes. The data ingestion service account's permissions should expire on March 31, 2026. The data science team's access should expire on December 31, 2025. The reporting team's access should be permanent.","""{
